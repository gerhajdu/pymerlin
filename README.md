# PyMERLIN: Metallicity Estimate of Rr Lyrae In the Near-infrared

 This routine estimates the iron abundance of RR Lyrae variables from their K-band light curve parameters, as determined by the PyFiNeR routine (https://github.com/gerhajdu/pyfiner)

 This routine was developed for:
 - Python 2.7
 - Numpy 1.12

## Installation

 Copy the files pymerlin, pymerlin.py, coefs_pca.npz, scaler_params.npz and pymerlin-regressors.pkl to the same directory in the system PATH
